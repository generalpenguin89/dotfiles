generalpenguin89's dotfiles repository

This is a freely available repository of some of my dotfiles.  I use
this to maintain a consistent environment between all of the Linux
machines that I use.  I have decided in addition to make this available
as a resource for others to use to get what I feel is a reasonably
decent default setup.
