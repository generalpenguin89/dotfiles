generalpenguin89's dotfiles repository

This is a freely available repository of some of my dotfiles.  I use
this to maintain a consistent environment between all of the Linux
machines that I use.  I have decided in addition to make this available
as a resource for others to use to get what I feel is a reasonably
decent default setup.

I have provided a Makefile with an install target.  WARNING: the install
target WILL overwrite any of your existing settings.  It will also
create local versions of these files named (the_file).local where you
can put local modifications that will not be overwritten on updates.

Feel free to contact me at generalpenguin89@gmail.com with any comments
or questions on any of these files.
