generalpenguin89's dotfiles repository

This is a freely available repository of some of my dotfiles.  I use
this to maintain a consistent environment between all of the Linux
machines that I use.  I have decided in addition to make this available
as a resource for others to use to get what I feel is a reasonably
decent default setup.

I have provided an env-setup script that will automatically checkout
this repository into ~/src/dotfiles.  WARNING: the script has been
created and tested within my environment and it may not work quite right
in your environment.  It will also create local versions of these files
named (the_file).local where you can put local modifications that will
not be overwritten on updates.

Feel free to contact me at generalpenguin89@gmail.com with any comments
or questions on any of these files.
